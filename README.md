**Do you need help with your application for Electrify? I'm at your service!**
> You have two options, choose the one you're more comfortable with:
> 1) Complete an *Application Form*[__recommended__]: https://bit.ly/34WqDw7 ;

Now we can get started! __In order to increase the chances of your application to be accepted, you have to answer with *as much detail as possible*!__ Try writing at least *4,5 to 8* sentences for every long question(Q5 & Q6). Also make sure to *read* [very carefully] *and understand* #rules-laws ! Looking through #jdot-documentation would also help.

> **Question 1** 
is quite self-explanatory. You have to write in your *full* discord username, *including the Discord # tag*.

> **Question 2** 
is also quite easy: it asks for your __exact__ XBOX/Minecraft username. It can be found above your character in the Minecraft Start Screen. *Upper-/lowercase letters, spaces, symbols and numbers matter!*

> **Question 3** 
asks for your *age* and *gender*. Keep in mind that gender doesn't have anything in common with sexuality!

> **Question 4** 
we need to know your timezone in order to provide easier communication. *Please provide it in GMT!* [For example, the timezone of Germany is GMT+1]. You can find out your timezone by googling for  `Timezone of <your town>` or clicking the link in the question text: https://bit.ly/2GKKnYX (not 100% reliable);

> **Question 5** 
is VERY important. You need to answer with as much detail as possible, providing examples, explanations, maybe something from your experience, etc. *The more you write, the more chances you get!*. (Some think of it as a short composition) __Ideally the answer has to be *4,5 - 8* sentences minimum.__

> **Question 6** 
it is also of GREAT importance: every advice from *Question 5* applies here as well. Feel free to take your time! https://bit.ly/2vM1R5a
